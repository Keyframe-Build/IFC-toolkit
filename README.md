# Ara 3D IFC Toolkit

A set of open-source C# libraries (.NET 8.0) 
for extremely fast loading and querying of IFC files in STEP format.

Currently it uses a copy of the [Web IFC engine](https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_web-ifc) to 
generate geometry from IFC files.

# Future Directions

This project will be integrating the [Plato.Geometry](https://github.com/ara3d/Plato.Geometry) to 
extract geometry and to generate meshes, to replace the dependency on the Web IFC Engine.
