# Ara 3D IFC Toolkit

A set of open-source C# libraries (.NET 8.0) 
for extremely fast loading and querying of IFC files in STEP format.

Currently it does not provide any utilities for generating geometry, or validating specific schemas.  

It is used by the [Web IFC .NET](https://github.com/ara3d/web-ifc-dotnet) project which uses 
the Web IFC engine to generate geometry from IFC files.

# Compiling

This repository is a submodule of the [Ara 3D mono-repo](https://githubcom/ara3d/ara3d) and the projects are intended to be compiled 
from the solution file contained there. 

# Future Directions

This project will integrate the [Plato.Geometry](https://github.com/ara3d/Plato.Geometry) to 
extract geometry and to generate meshes.
